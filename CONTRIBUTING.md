The general process for working with EF.DbContextFactory is:

1. [Fork](http://help.github.com/forking/) on GitHub
1. Clone your fork locally
1. Create a local branch
1. Work on your feature
1. Rebase/merge if required (from `develop` branch)
1. Push the branch up to GitHub 
1. Send a Pull Request on GitHub

You should **never** work on a clone of master, and you should **never** send a pull request from master - always from a branch.
